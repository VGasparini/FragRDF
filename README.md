# FragRDF - An schema-based RDF data fragmenter

The increasing volume of data published in RDF format requires distributed databases to address such demand. One challenge in this context is the data fragmentation so that it can be distributed later. This repository presents FragRDF, a tool for RDF data fragmentation. Unlike related approaches, FragRDF is able to fragment the database from a previously defined fragmentation schema. The experiments presented in this paper demonstrate that a centralized version of FragRDF is able to generate distributed databases up to 35 million of RDF triples.
